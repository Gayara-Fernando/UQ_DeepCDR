    "The bootstrap train code is in the phton script \"DeepCDR_train_with_new_generator_bootstraps.py\". This is a generic code, and is still not the improve-compliant one. This code defines the validation data generator (that is created by the regular generator construct and not the bootstrap), and the folder to store the bootstrap results outside the for loop for training the bootstrap models. Inside the for loop, it first defines the model, compile the model, train the model, save the model, evaluate the model, and also stores the validation predictions and the associated scores. However, we cannot store the predictions or the scores for the train data for the bootstrap work due to an assertion error that we get in the improve library (it basically checks if the train order of the predicted values is the same, but since in bootstraps we have some samples repeated, we will not be able to use the improve methods to store the predictions for the train data. Therefore, we will do this step in the next model train - NNe work)."
